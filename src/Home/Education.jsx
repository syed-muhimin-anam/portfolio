            I completed my Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) from BKSP (Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protishtan), where I balanced academics with my passion for sports. Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Physical Education and Sports Science at the University of Chittagong. I am in my 5th semester and on track to graduate in 2026. With a strong commitment to both academics and personal growth, I aim to achieve a good CGPA by the time I complete my studies. My journey so far reflects a blend of dedication to education and a deep connection to sports and physical development.</p>
