                            I use HTML5 and CSS3 to build well-structured, responsive web pages, with JavaScript (ES6+) for dynamic functionality. My frontend projects are built with ReactJS, using React Router for smooth navigation. For backend services, I rely on Firebase for authentication, hosting, and real-time data. I also use DaisyUI, a Tailwind CSS-based component library, to create clean and consistent user interfaces.

                               Gadget Heaven is a platform for discovering a wide range of
                                electrical gadgets. Users can browse products by category, view
                                detailed descriptions, and add items to their wishlist or cart.
                                Additionally, the dashboard enables users to manage their items
                                efficiently by viewing the total price and removing products as needed.

                            While working on the project, I occasionally found it challenging to implement exactly what I envisioned. At times, I forgot specific pieces of code or struggled to recall the right approach. Debugging errors also took longer than expected, especially when I got stuck and couldnâ€™t immediately find a solution. Reaching the desired outcome sometimes felt difficult and required extra effort and research. Additionally, managing time effectively was another hurdle, as balancing multiple tasks while learning new concepts occasionally slowed down progress.

                            In the future, I plan to enhance the frontend by improving animations, optimizing color combinations, and ensuring better responsiveness across all devices. I also aim to make the interface more user-friendly and intuitive, providing a smoother and more engaging experience for users.
